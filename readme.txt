== Description ==

Remove parent taxonomy slug(s) from term permalinks for hyerarchical taxonomies. That means an URL like `https://www.example.com/category/animals/dogs/german-shepherd/` becomes `https://www.example.com/category/german-shepherd/`.

== Installation ==

In WordPress admin section, navigate to `Plugins > Add New` and search for `No Parent Taxonomy Slug`. Once you find it, click on `Install` then on `Activate`. There are no settings or options for this plugin, it only requires installation and activation.

From then on, all hyerarchical terms will have their parent slugs(s) removed in the permalinks.
